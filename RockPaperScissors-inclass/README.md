# Class 2: Understanding Java
Project is setup for the first night of Lecture. The Solution
that I will work through is under the branch 2015.

The following items will be accomplished as we discuss Java the 
language:
ApplicationTest.java (write test cases)
- TODO: Implement the logic to make this test case pass.
- TODO: Implement the following logic
- TODO: Implement the following logic

GameUtils.java (write logic in a utility class)
- TODO: Implement a random number generator that returns of of the three games options.
- TODO: Create an Interface that has a super type method named eval.
- TODO: Create classes that implement the interface.
- TODO: Based on playerChoice, create an instance of that object (IE Rock)
- TODO: Call the eval method on that object passing in the computer's choice.
- TODO: Implement the logic for each of the game types to determine the winner.
